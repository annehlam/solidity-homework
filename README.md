# solidity-homework

For this homework, I did the Level One: AssociateProfitSplitter.  The purpose of the contract is to accept Ether and divide the it evenly among the associate level employees quickly and efficiently.  After distributing equally, it will send whatever is left over back to Human Resources.

I ran into some issues as the solidity file was able to be compiled, and it looked like it ran successfully but it said my wallet had insufficient funds.  I suspect it is due to a mistake from when I was linking with Metamask (maybe I linked it to the wrong wallet/account?).  However, it looked like the transaction did work because it gave me a gas estimate.

Screenshots can be viewed in the Pictures folder!
